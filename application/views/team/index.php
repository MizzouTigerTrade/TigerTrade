			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I am Jason McQuinn, and I am from an extremely small town named Stanberry. Stanberry is only a population of slightly more than a thousand people. I graduated from Stanberry High School in 2010, with the intentions of majoring in Mechanical Engineering at Mizzou. Around the time of my sophomore year in college, I decided that this was not the right major for me. I had some experience with Computer Science in high school and enjoyed the subject. During high school, I took a Computer Science course for all four years of my high school career. As a part of these courses, our class would attend an annual Computer Science Olympiad at Northwest Missouri State University, and as a result placing among the top during three out of the four years, I quickly became hooked to this course subject. In addition to learning about computer science, I found that I loved the problem solving that came with the programming side.</p> 
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">This past summer I did some freelance Website designs for a couple of companies. I loved doing them and learned even more than what I previously knew. I am great with anything that has to deal with the HTML side of programming. I have a depth of knowledge when dealing with PHP also. Both of my webpages were built on the foundations of these two languages, and I find these to be my strongest abilities. However, I also consider myself to be decent at C/C++, VisualBasic, and Java and more than decent with CSS. These languages are not as strong as my knowledge of HTML and PHP. I would like to work on something that deals with a web application, or the creation of a new website that could have the potential to turn into something that will make a lasting impression.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-1"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/Images/team/timg.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"></div>
		<div class="col-sm-7 team-member-description"><p style="text-indent: 40px;">My name is Tim Gilman and I am currently a senior at Mizzou. A little bit of history about myself I was born in Eureka, MO and went to high school at a tiny school in St. Louis called Principia. I just recently turned 22 and have an awesome all white husky puppy named aria.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Over the past four years at Mizzou I have had the opportunity to do two internships and one co-op. After my sophomore year at Mizzou I did my first internship at a software engineering company called Technekes. Here I used ruby with the rails framework to develop websites. I implemented test driven development on the projects. I also used both relational and non-relational databases for the projects I worked on. 
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The summer following my junior year I did a co-op with Monsanto, which lasted from June till December. In this co-op I also created web applications but this one I used java and apex to create these. The database I used was an sql one. I did not create any new database tables or entities with the websites I created but used existing ones to update data. For the project I worked on I was able to take something all the way through the software engineering lifecycle from design to implementation that is now being used at Monsanto.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">This past summer I had the opportunity to work at Missouri Employers Mutual, which is a workers compensation insurance company here in Columbia. I developed an online competition application for them that was used company wide during their annual 'worksafe' week in August. For this project I used php with the codeigniter framework and an oracle database. I created all my tables from scratch and this is a stand alone application not needing any information from other applications.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Most all of my work has been doing web design of some sort and using the model-view-controller framework, which I enjoy using a lot. I currently do not have a team I am working on and do not have a project in mind that could possibly make everyone millions, although I wish I did. I am open to any ideas for projects and would be up to join any team that would seem to need another person.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-1"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/Images/team/timv.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"></div>
		<div class="col-sm-7 team-member-description"><p style="text-indent: 40px;">My name is Timothy Van Horn and I’m currently a senior at Mizzou. I am majoring in Information technology, with a minor in business. I was born just outside the city of St. Louis and grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis in a city named Wildwood. I’m the third out of four children in my family. Most of my childhood was spent playing sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball and football. Both of my parents are veterinarians so our house was always filled with animals. I also love animals so I was always eager to get a new pet. Some of the pets I’ve had include dogs, cats, lizards, hamsters, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs and birds. Once I got to high school most of my attention was focused on sports. I played football at my high school for four years. I also played basketball for two years and baseball for three years. Since high school I have been attending school at Mizzou. When I first came to Mizzou I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do for a career. I finally decided to pursue a bachelor of science in information technology during second semester of my freshmen year due to a programming class that I really enjoyed. About a year after that I decided to also pursue a minor in business. I don’t have a dream job or company in mind for when I graduate college. Over the past few years of school web development has really caught my interest. I would really enjoy working in the web development field after college.</p>
