		<div class="col-sm-7 team-member-description"><p style="text-indent: 40px;">I'm a senior at Mizzou getting a major in Information Technology with a minor in Business. I was born and raised in the St. Louis area. I'm a big fan of the St. Louis Cardinals and the other St. Louis teams. I attended high school at Lafayette in Wildwood, Missouri. In high school I mainly focussed on sports and had no interest in web development until later in college.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">When I first began school at Mizzou I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. After taking a few programming classes I started to gain a huge interest in web development. I'll be graduating from Mizzou in May of 2015. After graduation I plan to move back to St. Louis and work for a company as a web developer.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-7 team-member-description"><p style="text-indent: 40px;">I was born and raised in a small community of Stanberry, MO. Being the youngest of five, I always knew I had big shoes to fill. I enjoy spending time with family, friends, and my girlfriend. I enjoy programming and playing any kind of sport, including fishing.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">After graduating high school, I began attending the University of Missouri-Columbia and started off majoring in Mechanical Engineering, but then switched my major to Computer Science during my sophomore year. I am now a senior and will be graduating in December 2015.</p>
