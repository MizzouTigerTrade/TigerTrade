		<div class="col-sm-7 team-member-description"><p>My name is Tim Gilman and I am currently a senior at Mizzou. A little bit of history about myself I was born in Eureka, MO and went to high school at a tiny school in St. Louis called Principia. I just recently turned 22 and have an awesome all white husky puppy named aria.</p>
			<p>Over the past four years at Mizzou I have had the opportunity to do two internships and one co-op. After my sophomore year at Mizzou I did my first internship at a software engineering company called Technekes. Here I used ruby with the rails framework to develop websites. I implemented test driven development on the projects. I also used both relational and non-relational databases for the projects I worked on. 
			<p>The summer following my junior year I did a co-op with Monsanto, which lasted from June till December. In this co-op I also created web applications but this one I used java and apex to create these. The database I used was an sql one. I did not create any new database tables or entities with the websites I created but used existing ones to update data. For the project I worked on I was able to take something all the way through the software engineering lifecycle from design to implementation that is now being used at Monsanto.</p>
			<p>This past summer I had the opportunity to work at Missouri Employers Mutual, which is a workers compensation insurance company here in Columbia. I developed an online competition application for them that was used company wide during their annual ‘worksafe’ week in August. For this project I used php with the codeigniter framework and an oracle database. I created all my tables from scratch and this is a stand alone application not needing any information from other applications.</p>
			<p>Most all of my work has been doing web design of some sort and using the model-view-controller framework, which I enjoy using a lot. I currently do not have a team I am working on and do not have a project in mind that could possibly make everyone millions, although I wish I did. I am open to any ideas for projects and would be up to join any team that would seem to need another person.</p>
